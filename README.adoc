== Gradle vs. Maven

This repository contains the following:

* The_Presentation.pptx - a few slides comparing Gradle to maven and other Java build tools.
* parent-maven - a multi-module with three level organization Maven project
* parent-gradle - a multi-module with three level organization Gradle project


== Purpose
If you have doubts about using Maven or Gradle in your project, this short presentation and the attached projects might
help you make a decision.

If you need a starting template for a multi-module, multi-level project you might find this toy projects useful as well.

If you have any ideas on how I could improve these projects send me an email or create an issue.
